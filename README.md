udp2serial
==========

a bridge between udp packets and a tty serial port, framing the udp packet data on the serial line with slip developed to use the OSC protocol on the Arduino Yun

version 1.0  11/18/2013

on Arduino (1.5.4) it has been tested with the OSC library: https://github.com/CNMAT/OSC
on Processing (2.1) with the OSC library: http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/

the included slip.py is copyright of Roman Haeflei https://github.com/reduzent/pyslip

the OSC packets sent from the Arduino go forwared to the last peer that sent a packet to the Yun.

Setup procedure:

on linino the serial port is attached the the console, for proper functioning the console must be disabled
edit /etc/inittab  
commenting this line #ttyATH0::askfirst:/bin/ash --login
and rebooting

copy udp2serial.py and slip.py in /usr/bin of the Yun
for example: scp udp2serial.py root@arduino.local:/usr/bin

to run the program interactively from an ssh console type python /usr/bin/udp2serial.py
this is recomended since the code is not heavily tested and the program may stop

an initscrip is provided  in /system/etc/init.d/udp2serial 
copy it to the linino corresponding folder for automatc startup
this script also resets the arduino microcontoller for clean buffers status

the UDP ports are coded as constants, defaults are: receive on port 10000, send on port 11000


Examples:
the included example for Arduino OSC_Echo_SLIP receives an osc message and echoes it back to the sender
the Processing examples sends a message to the Yun and receives it back (press i or b)
